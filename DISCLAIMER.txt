This document is an educational article on how chart files are organized and parsed
by the arcade game maimai. The author doesn't by anyway condone the piracy, illegal operation,
modification or reverse engineering of maimai arcade game software/cabinets, since such actions
may violate Japanese or international laws.

The information in this document was obtained through the study of non-binary files and how 
the data within it was reflected in game. During the creation of this document, no reverse-engineering 
of binary files and codes within the game took place, and no information in this document was drawn 
out as a result of said actions. No copyrighted images, videos, audio, or binary files are provided 
with this documentation. Images, videos, and excerpts of files are recreated, independent from their original material, 
or are public domain. The creation and modification of "charts" is considered fair use under terms of interoperability.
